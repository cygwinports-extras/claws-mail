sdesc: "Claws Mail bogofilter plugin"
ldesc: "Enables the scanning of incoming mail received from a POP, IMAP, 
or LOCAL account using Bogofilter. It can optionally delete mail 
identified as spam or save it to a designated folder. Bogofilter is a 
pure Bayesian filter, therefore it has better speed performance than 
SpamAssassin but might catch less spam."
